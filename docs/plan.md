2. Implement API documentation
3. Add visualization UI
4. Set up Docker support

### Long-term Vision (Beyond Week 8)
1. Support multiple algorithm implementations
2. Implement result persistence
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
4. Add performance benchmarking

## Conclusion

This improvement plan provides a structured approach to enhancing the Convex Hull Algorithm project. By following this plan, the project will become more maintainable, robust, and feature-rich while serving as an excellent demonstration platform for IntelliJ's AI assistant features.

The improvements are designed to be implemented incrementally, allowing for continuous delivery of value while maintaining the project's stability. Regular reviews and adjustments to the plan are recommended as implementation progresses.
